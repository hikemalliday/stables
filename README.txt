-Open up stables.bat and type out the dir path to the app folder:
-EXAMPLE: cd c:\users\mikeg\desktop\projects\mikesprojects\roladex


**TIPS/QUIRKS**
-Item/inventory queries are case sensitive, however character name queries are not (im just bad is why)
-Some buttons require a browser refresh to see the results
-The P99 Dir requires a '/' at the end. Function will not work otherwise.
-When entering the P99 dir, just press ENTER and it will work. There is no submit button and it may look like nothing happened. Just refresh the page, re-open the modal, and you should see the correct DIR display.

-WHEN ENTERING A NEW CHARACTER:
  -The first letter should be uppercased, because the output inventory and spellbook files are case sensitive.
  -If things are not formatted correctly, things may not function properly.

-WHEN OUTPUTING INVENTORY SPELL FILES-
  -Output Inventory files must be formatted as such: output inventory Charname 
  -Output spellbook files must be formatted as such: output spellbook Charnamespells
  -THESE ARE CASE SENSITIVE, so the first letter must be uppercased.
