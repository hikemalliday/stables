-The file copier might be breaking and ending if a file does not exist
-Query seems to double print items on individual character inventory query
-Fix modal labels
-Fix sorting for any and all tables
-FIX EDIT BUTTON

-Remove first two table lines in 'inventoryObject' arrays (when you open up an individual chars inventory, the first two rows are redundant)
-Combine BAT files

--MISSING SPELL BUGS--
-Create outputspellbook for Macros
-Create outputspellbook for Rickjames
-Missing Spells button changes to 'Back', when 'Back' is clicked, rebuild the modal as if it was just opened

--Add 'modal Close' to new character 'submit' button
--need to make a giant object with: {character:[[],[],[],[]], character: [[],[],[],[]]} (??? what is this ???)

--**ADD BAT (CHILD_PROCESS) FOR RUNNING BAT INSIDE PROGRAM**--
  -the idea is to have a button to click to copy over a new UI for a character
  -also a button to copy ALL characters
  -UIs will be copied based on class
  -also make buttons to copy output inventory files, output spellbook files. For ALL characters, as well as individual
  -individual buttons will be inside the 'inventory' modals
  -'ALL Characters' buttons will be on the main interface

--**LOOK INTO AN ALL IN ONE INSTALLER / UI SO THAT THE PROGRAM IS SHAREABLE**--
  -all in one installer 
  -possibly in the future some sort of cloud inventory upload program. 
  -users could register, and log in. Then, anyone in the guild can upload an 'output inventory' file
  -this allows the guild to perform item queries
  -could create a discord bot to store output inventory files, allowing a guild to perform gueries in discord
